## Ready to (re-)read!
_Josias, 21.07.2021_

The first part of the research is done so far (see the researched sources below). Next step is to (re-)read a lot and get a good overview of the sources, so that the writing of the theoretical part of the paper can start next week.

Fyi: To keep track over the tasks and progress I set up a [timeline](https://github.com/josiasbruderer/bbs-for-independence/projects/1){:target="_blank"}. Feel free to check it out! :-)
