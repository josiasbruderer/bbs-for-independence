  {"id":"beerSociologyWebInitial2007","abstract":"This paper introduces the idea of Web 2.0 to a sociological audience as a key example of a process of cultural digitization that is moving faster than our ability to analyse it. It offers a definition, a schematic overview and a typology of the notion as part of a commitment to a renewal of description in sociology. It provides examples of wikis, folksonomies, mashups and social networking sites and, where possible and by way of illustration, examines instances where sociology and sociologists are featured. The paper then identifies three possible agendas for the development of a viable sociology of Web 2.0: the changing relations between the production and consumption of internet content; the mainstreaming of private information posted to the public domain; and, the emergence of a new rhetoric of ‘democratisation’. The paper concludes by discussing some of the ways in which we can engage with these new web applications and go about developing sociological understandings of the new online cultures as they become increasingly significant in the mundane routines of everyday life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Beer","given":"David"},{"family":"Burrows","given":"Roger"}],"container-title":"Sociological Research Online","container-title-short":"Sociological Research Online","DOI":"10.5153/sro.1560","ISSN":"1360-7804, 1360-7804","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,9]]},"language":"en","page":"67-79","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sociology and, of and in Web 2.0: Some Initial Considerations","title-short":"Sociology and, of and in Web 2.0","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5153/sro.1560","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"costaHowWorldChanged2016a","abstract":"How the World Changed Social Media is the first book in Why We Post, a book series that investigates the findings of nine anthropologists who each spent 15 months living in communities across the world. This book offers a comparative analysis summarising the results of the research and exploring the impact of social media on politics and gender, education and commerce. What is the result of the increased emphasis on visual communication? Are we becoming more individual or more social? Why is public social media so conservative? Why does equality online fail to shift inequality offline? How did memes become the moral police of the internet? Supported by an introduction to the project's academic framework and theoretical terms that help to account for the findings, the book argues that the only way to appreciate and understand something as intimate and ubiquitous as social media is to be immersed in the lives of the people who post. Only then can we discover how people all around the world have already transformed social media in such unexpected ways and assess the consequences.","author":[{"family":"Costa","given":"Elisabetta"},{"family":"Haynes","given":"Nell"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Nicolescu","given":"Razvan"},{"family":"Sinanan","given":"Jolynna"}],"ISBN":"978-1-910634-50-9 978-1-910634-49-3 978-1-910634-51-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1125091843","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"How the world changed social media","type":"book"},

It traces the shifting accents of utopia consequent on the move beyond modernity - a shift from time to space and from content to process.

  {"id":"merrillProvableLimitationsAcquiring2021","abstract":"Language models trained on billions of tokens have recently led to unprecedented results on many NLP tasks. This success raises the question of whether, in principle, a system can ever ``understand'' raw text without access to some form of grounding. We formally investigate the abilities of ungrounded systems to acquire meaning. Our analysis focuses on the role of ``assertions'': textual contexts that provide indirect clues about the underlying semantics. We study whether assertions enable a system to emulate representations preserving semantic relations like equivalence. We find that assertions enable semantic emulation of languages that satisfy a strong notion of semantic transparency. However, for classes of languages where the same expression can take different values in different contexts, we show that emulation can become uncomputable. Finally, we discuss differences between our formal model and natural language, exploring how our results generalize to a modal setting and other semantic relations. Together, our results suggest that assertions in code or language do not provide sufficient signal to fully emulate semantic representations. We formalize ways in which ungrounded language models appear to be fundamentally limited in their ability to ``understand''.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Merrill","given":"William"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Yoav"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Roy"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Noah A."}],"container-title":"arXiv:2104.10809 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,22]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Provable Limitations of Acquiring Meaning from Ungrounded Form: What Will Future Language Models Understand?","title-short":"Provable Limitations of Acquiring Meaning from Ungrounded Form","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10809"},
